# Morphological processing
Morphological operations are operations based on image shapes and more generally on binary images. Two images are required for this. The first is an original image and the second is called the kernel or structuring element.
They take the input image and the structuring element and are joined using set operations.
Some of the morphological operations are: Erosion, dilation, opening and closing.

## Erosion
Erosion is similar to soil erosion. It erodes the boundaries of the foreground image.
